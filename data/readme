Data for regression

Source: pgn files from The Week in Chess.

Postions are saved with the following conditions:
* If the move in the game is not a capture, and not a checking move and not a promote move and the side to move is not in check and the game has either 1-0 or 0-1 result.

Data format:
<epd>, <pawn_diff = white_pawn_count - black_pawn_count> <knight_diff>, <bishop_diff>, <rook_diff>, <queen_diff>, <game_result>

Example:
R4n2/4k3/P3n2p/5R2/8/7P/2r3PK/8 b - -,2,-2,0,1,0,1
pawn_diff = 2 (white is ahead by 2 pawns)
knight_diff = -2 (black is ahead by 2 knights)
bishop_diff = 0
rook_diff = 1 (white is ahead by 1 rook)
queen_diff = 0
result = 1 (white wins this game)


game_result:
  * If white wins, set it to 1.
  * If black wins, set it to 0.
