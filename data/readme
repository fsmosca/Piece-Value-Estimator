Data for regression

Source: pgn files from The Week in Chess.

Postions are saved with the following conditions:
* If the move in the game is not a capture, or not a checking move or not a promote move, save it.
* If side to move is not in check, save it.
* If position is from the game with 1-0 or 0-1 results.

Data format:
<epd>, <pawn_diff = wpawn_count - blackpawn_count> <knight_diff>, <bishop_diff>, <rook_diff>, <queen_diff>, <game_result>

game_result:
  * If white wins, set it to 1.
  * If black wins, set it to 0.
